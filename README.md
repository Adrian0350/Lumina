# Lumina
Is a base system for automatic relay triggering.

In this instance I used the code to trigger a group of lamps with adjustable daylight intensity triggering.
It is completely expandable. Depending on your needs you might or might not need
to add more components (a multiplexer for instance).


## Basic Components
* Arduino UNO (with Atmega328P-PU as ISP)
* Atmega328P-PU
* 10kΩ resistor (1)
* 560Ω resistors (3)
* 450Ω resistors (3)
* 22μF ceramic resistors (2)
* 16MHz Crystal (1)
* 10kΩ Potentiometers (3)
* Light dependant resistors —LDR— (2)
* 5v-1A phone charger
* Lots of cables
