# Lumina
Is a base system for automatic relay triggering using declarative programming.

In this instance I used the code to trigger a group of lamps with adjustable daylight intensity triggering.
Although the function of luminosity is not in Lumens it's still pretty accurate.
Will upgrade functionality with the use of real Lumen scale.

It is completely expandable. Depending on your needs you might or might not need
to add more components or code (a multiplexer for instance).
